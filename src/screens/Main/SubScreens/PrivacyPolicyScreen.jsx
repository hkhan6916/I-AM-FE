        You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by
        clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by

      </Text>
      <Text style={{ margin: 10 }}>
        {"\n"}
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
        notice.

        parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all

        please contact us using the contact information provided below, and

        be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g.
        backups, etc.).
